# QuizCode

# Description:

This assignment I will be resubmitting as I ran out of time for the assignment due to circumstances out of my control.

The assignment was to create a quiz based on HTML, CSS & Javascript.

There was no starter code provided

The quiz should be timed, and keep track of highscores. When one question is answered the next should appear.

Highscores should be kept in local client side storage, saving initials and score.

# Actions Taken:

Used semantic HTML with added stylesheet and javscript to make the HTM dynamic - used CSS grid to position my containers for the quiz. Using Functions to create the quiz game path.

# Remaining work:

Still need to create the scoring system logic to my JS and then, use client side - local storage to store the users score and inititals.

I also need to fix the bug with the timer decreasing below 0secs and the game should end on 0sec.
